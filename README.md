# About me

My name is Richard. I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student at Inteli (Instituto de Tecnologia e Lideran√ßa), currently focused on learning backend development and systems programming.

I am studying Rust, JavaScript and computer science fundamentals on my own through books, structured exercises, and practice projects. I prioritize depth, clarity, and long-term understanding in everything I do.

This GitHub is organized to reflect my learning process and growth. Each project or exercise here exists to solidify concepts, not to demonstrate results. My goal is to build a foundation that enables real excellence, not just familiarity.
